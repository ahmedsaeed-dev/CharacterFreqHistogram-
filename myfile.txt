Each instructor may make known to the student his or her policy with respect to absences in the course. It is the student’s responsibility to be aware of this policy. The instructor makes the final decision to excuse or not to excuse an absence. An instructor is entitled to give a failing grade (E) for excessive absences or an Unofficial Drop (UE) for a student who stops attending class at some point during the semester.Academic IntegrityThe University of Michigan-Dearborn values academic honesty and integrity.  Each student has a responsibility to understand, accept, and comply with the University’s standards of academic conduct as set forth by the Code of Academic Conduct (http://www.umd.umich.edu/policies_st-rights/), as well as policies established by each college. Cheating, collusion, misconduct, fabrication, and plagiarism are considered serious offenses, and may be monitored using tools including but not limited to TurnItIn. Violations can result in penalties up to and including expulsion from the University. At the instructor’s discretion, the penalty may be a grade of zero on the assignment up to and including recommending that the student be expelled from the University. It is the sole responsibility of the student to understand and follow academic guidelines regarding plagiarism. The University of Michigan–Dearborn has an online academic integrity tutorial that can be accessed at http://webapps.umd.umich.edu/aim.  Although students are encouraged to help their classmates, students sharing code are guilty of plagiarism. If programs are considered too similar, the students will be asked to explain. The Dean will be notified about any such offenses as well as the Academic Code of Conduct Committee.  In all cases of cheating, students who supply code or take it will both be penalized. The penalty for all students involved in cheating is failure in the class.Disability StatementThe University will make reasonable accommodations for persons with documented disabilities. Students need to register with Disability Resource Services (DRS) every semester they are enrolled for classes. DRS is located in Counseling & Support Services, 2157 UC.  To be assured of having services when they are needed, students should register no later than the end of the add/drop deadline of each term.  Visit the DRS website at: http://www.umd.umich.edu/cs_disability/. If you have a disability that necessitates an accommodation or adjustment to the academic requirements stated in this syllabus, you must register with DRS as described above and notify your professor.  Upon receipt of your written notification, we will make accommodations as directed by DRS.SafetyAll students are strongly encouraged to register in the campus Emergency Alert System, used to communicate with the campus community during an emergency. More information on the system and how it works, along with enrollment information can be found at: http://umemergencyalert.umd.umich.edu/ Please note that the system will only communicate through UM-Dearborn email accounts,  so if you primarily use a non-university account you should forward your UM-Dearborn email to your primary account.All students are also encouraged to program 911 and UM-Dearborn’s Public Safety phone number (313) 593-5333 into personal cell phones.
